Normally, in this directory should be a Python runtime. However, it would make more sense if you were to download and put it in here yourself.

1) Check if you have Python installed. If so, skip to step 6.
2) Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
3) Run the installer and select customize installation.
4) Check only "pip" and "Tcl/Tk and IDLE".
5) Select the installation directory.
6) Copy the root of the folder containing "python.exe" and "pythonw.exe" to this folder (env).
7) Shift-click "pythonw.exe" and select Copy as path.
8) In a cmd window, type: {what you copied} -m pip install pygame
			  		       pip install pypresence
					       pip install requests
9) Get SilentCMD and place it on the same directory as "env" and "scripts".				       
10) Place "trannosrun.py" on the same directory as SilentCMD and run it.
